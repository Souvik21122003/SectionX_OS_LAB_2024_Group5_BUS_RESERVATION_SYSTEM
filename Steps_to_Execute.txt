Steps to Execute

Prerequisites
1. Install GCC compiler for C programs.
2. Ensure the system supports socket programming (Linux recommended).
3. Create the required text files:
   - users.txt: Store user credentials.
   - bus.txt: Store bus details.

Server Execution
1. Open a terminal.
2. Compile the server code:
   gcc -o server server.c
3. Run the server:
   ./server
4. The server will start listening for client connections on port 8080.

Client Execution
1. Open another terminal.
2. Compile the client code:
   gcc -o client client.c
3. Run the client:
   ./client
4. Interact with the system by following the on-screen instructions:
   - Select User or Admin.
   - Provide login credentials or sign up if using the system for the first time.
   - Use features like searching for buses, booking tickets, and managing buses (Admin).

Files Used
1. users.txt:
   - Format:
     username password
   - Example:
     user1 password123
     admin adminpass
2. bus.txt:
   - Format:
     BusID Source Destination SeatsAvailable

Testing the System
1. Start the server before running any clients.
2. Run multiple clients (in separate terminals) to simulate different users.
3. Perform various operations:
   - Users: Search, book tickets, view details.
   - Admins: Add or update bus details.

Shutting Down
1. Stop the server using Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running.
2. Ensure all client terminals are closed.
